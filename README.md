# Heart-disease-prediction

# Overview
Machine Learning is one of the most widely used concepts around the world. It will be essential in the healthcare sectors which will be useful for doctors to fasten the diagnosis. In this article, we will be dealing with the Heart disease dataset and will analyze, predict the result whether the patient has heart disease or normal, i.e. Heart disease prediction using Machine Learning. This prediction will make it faster and more efficient in healthcare sectors which will be a time-consuming process.

# Steps
1. Data Analysis: This process involves data cleaning, data statistics, getting insights from the dataset.
2. Algorithm Implementation: This involves four machine learning algorithms which will result in performance metrics of the model.
3. Model Implementation: The well-doing algorithm is implemented in the model and checking results with the real-time data.
